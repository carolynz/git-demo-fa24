## Git Commands

If you are using Git from the command line, here are some basic commands to get you started:

- Clone: `git clone [repository-url]`
- Stage changes: `git add .`
- Commit: `git commit -m "Your message here"`
- Push: `git push origin main`

Remember to pull the latest changes before pushing: `git pull`

## Tips for Avoiding Conflicts

- Always pull the latest changes before starting to work.
- Try to edit different parts of the file from your classmates.
- Talk and coordinate before you commit changes.
- If you encounter a merge conflict, ask for help. It's not a technical issue but a communication issue. Work with whoever else made the changes to resolve the conflict.
